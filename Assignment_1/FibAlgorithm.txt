STEP 1:	START
STEP 2:	Declare n1=0,n2=1, i=1 and fib=0
STEP 3:	If i=1 Print 0
	If i =2 Print 1
	Goto STEP 6

STEP 4:	fib = n1+n2
	n1=n2
	n2=fib

STEP 5:	Print fib
STEP 6:	i = i+1
STEP 7:	if i<=5 goto STEP 3
STEP 8:	STOP


#Assignment
Though the Recursive approach may seem to be faster in terms of time complexity, it is only true for a smaller 'n' value.
For Fibonacci if n = 50 , the loop method is very much faster compared to its recursive counterpart.
